ANNOUNCEMENTS:

* New mailing address

  We've updated our mailing address; the new address is:

  ARP Networks, Inc.
  8605 Santa Monica Blvd
  PMB 71478
  West Hollywood, CA 90069-4109
  USA

* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA / 2FA) for Portal logins is now an option

  This adds an additional layer of security to your Portal account by requiring more than just a password to sign in.

  Click the new "Security" item under the Main Menu to get started.

* Stripe

  We've been diligently working on migrating to a new payments processor.

  The new processor provides us additional capabilities:

  - Apple Pay
  - Google Pay
  - Handle 3DS and Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) when required
  - Payment by ACH (coming soon)
  - Payment by Stripe Link (coming soon)
  - ...and over 10 other non-US payment capabilities

  If you received a link to your receipt and invoice hosted by Stripe, you've already been migrated and can take advantage of these new capabilities.

  If not, you can help us speed up the process by:

  - Login to the Portal
  - Click "Credit Card"
  - Re-enter your payment info (we legally cannot do this for you)

  and that's it!  You'll be migrated by the next billing cycle.
