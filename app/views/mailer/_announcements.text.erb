ANNOUNCEMENTS:

* A New Portal is Launching!

  We've built a brand-new customer portal from the ground up, codenamed Phoenix.

  It includes many long-requested features:

  - Launch servers without pre-allocated IP blocks
  - Order and provision reserved IP blocks instantly
  - Multiple logins per account with role-based access
  - Hourly billing
  - On-demand ARP Thunder™ servers
  - Integrated support system -- no more leaving your dashboard
  - SSH key management
  - Seamless cancellations -- no ticket required

  Starting March 1, we will begin migrating customers from the existing
  portal to Phoenix. Your existing services and billing will carry over
  automatically. Note that MFA will need to be re-enrolled after
  migration. No other action is required on your part -- just sit tight.
  We expect all migrations to be complete by April 1.

  If you'd like to move to the front of the line, drop us a note at
  support@arpnetworks.com and we'll get you set up early.
