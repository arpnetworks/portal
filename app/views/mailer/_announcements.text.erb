ANNOUNCEMENTS:

* Stripe

  We've been diligently working on migrating to a new payments processor.

  The new processor provides us additional capabilities:

  - Apple Pay
  - Google Pay
  - Handle 3DS and Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) when required
  - Payment by ACH (coming soon)
  - Payment by Stripe Link (coming soon)
  - ...and over 10 other non-US payment capabilities

  If you received a link to your receipt and invoice hosted by Stripe, you've already been migrated and can take advantage of these new capabilities.

  If not, you can help us speed up the process by:

  - Login to the Portal
  - Click "Credit Card"
  - Re-enter your payment info (we legally cannot do this for you)

  and that's it!  You'll be migrated by the next billing cycle.
