Hi <%= @account.display_name %>,

Re: VPS labeled "<%= @vm.label %>" 
    and UUID <%= @vm.uuid %>

Our Nagios monitor shows that your VPS fails to respond to our pings.

If you block ICMP, please consider opening it up for 208.79.88.56, so
our monitoring can be alerted if there is a problem with your host.

More information about our monitoring can be found here:
http://support.arpnetworks.com/faqs/vps/vps-monitoring

If your VPS really is unreachable to you, let us know if you need
help with getting it back up.

Thanks!

P.S. If we continue to be unable to monitor your VPS, you will probably
receive this message again.
