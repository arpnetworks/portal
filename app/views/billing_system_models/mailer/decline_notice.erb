Hi <%= @account.first_name %>,

This is the Billing Department at ARP Networks, Inc.

Recently, your credit card<%= @account.credit_card ? " (**" + @account.credit_card.display_number.to_s + ") " : ' ' %>has declined or expired, and we require
new or updated credit card information in order to keep your account active.

To update your credit card information, please login to the Portal:

https://portal.arpnetworks.com

and click the "Credit Card" link located on the left sidebar.

You may then click "Pay Invoices" from the dashboard and immediately
bring your account current.

The account in question has username "<%= @account.login %>"

Please make sure the billing address you provide matches the one for
your card.  Some banks will decline your card right away, even if there
are sufficient funds, if we don't provide them with the correct billing
address.

If you do not click "Pay Invoices" at this time, we will re-try charging
your credit card within 5 business days after it has been updated.

Your prompt cooperation is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.
