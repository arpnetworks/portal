- Layout

  - Container

    A simple container to center your content horizontally

- Elements

  - Content

    A single class to handle WYSIWYG generated content, where only HTML
    tags are available.

    When you can't use the CSS classes you want, or when you just want
    to directly use HTML tags, use content as container. It can handle
    almost any HTML tag.

    This content class can be used in any context where you just want to
    (or can only) write some **text**.
